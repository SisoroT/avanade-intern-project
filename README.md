# Intern Project

This project is a website that allows users to find the average gas price in a specific location in the U.S. and compare the gas prices based on states. It also puts our knowledge of Azure services to use!

# Using the Website

There are **multiple ways to get information** through the website.
Users can search by **zipcode** or **through a map**.
We also provide a **page with all the average state prices** in one place.

## Searching by Zipcode

The **zipcode** page allows users to input any **US** zipcode and receive the **average gas prices** for:

-   the **given zipcode**
-   the **state that zipcode is in**
-   the entire **US**

The user is also provided with the state and national average gas prices based on the data in our azure SQL database which updates prices automatically every Sunday at midnight.

## Searching by Map

The **map** page allows users to click anywhere within the US and **drop a pin** to get information.
Users can **pan and zoom** to get to the precise location desired. The information mirrors that provided by the zipcode page.

## Prices by State

The **state prices** page allows users to see **today's average gas prices** for **every US state plus Washington DC**.
Users can **sort** the page in ascending or descending order either **alphabetically** or **by price** by clicking the label at the top of a column.
